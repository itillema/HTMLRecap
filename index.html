    <p><strong>Elon Reeve Musk</strong> FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. 
        He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. 
        A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.
    </p>
    <p>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. 
        He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. 
        He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelors' degrees in economics and physics. 
        He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. 
        The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. 
        Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. 
        The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
    </p>
    <p>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. 
        In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. 
        In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. 
        In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. 
        In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. 
        Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
    </p>
    <p>Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. 
        In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a diver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. 
        In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. 
        He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. 
        Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.

    <h3>Early life</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. 
        His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa. 
        His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer. 
        Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). 
        His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian, and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. 
        After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted. 
        Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he has described as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done." 
        He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.

            Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. 
            Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. 
            Musk led the Series A round of investment in 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as chairman. 
            Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. 
            Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. 
            Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. 
            A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others (See video to the right).

    <p>
        In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. 
        A particular focus of the company is to "counteract large corporations [and governments] who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems". 
        In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.

    <h3>Wealth</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Musk made $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002. He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion. 
        Throughout that year, his net worth increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock. 
        During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 
        In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest. 
        In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world. 
        Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.

        In an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a "significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats," but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. 
        Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement to have a voice in the United States government. 
        Musk has criticized Donald Trump and after joining Trump's two business advisory councils, Musk resigned from both in June 2017 in protest against Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. 
        In the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income; he endorsed Kanye West's independent campaign in the general election. 
        Musk has stated that he thinks a theoretical government on Mars should be direct democracy.
